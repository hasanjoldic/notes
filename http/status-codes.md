| `5xx` | **Server Error**           | Server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the requested method.                                                                       |

| `502` | Bad Gateway                | Server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request.        |
| `503` | Service Unavailable        | Server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay.    |
| `504` | Gateway Time-out           | Server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request. |

| `207` | Multi-Status                    | provides status for multiple independent operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `226` | IM Used                         | The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.                                                                                                          |
| `308` | Permanent Redirect              | The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource outght to use one of the enclosed URIs.

| `422` | Unprocessable Entity            | Server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions. |
| `423` | Locked                          | Source or destination resource of a method is locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `431` | Request Header Fields Too Large | Server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `506` | Variant Also Negotiates         | Server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.                                                                              |
