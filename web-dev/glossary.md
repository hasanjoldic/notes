## Origin

Web content's origin is defined by the `scheme` (protocol), `hostname` (domain), and `port` of the URL used to access it. **Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, hostname, and port all match.**

Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using **CORS**.
